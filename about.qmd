I am now a master of Business Analytics in Monash University. I have learnt how to catch wild data, communicate with data, and data visualization..... I confirm that these skills could equip me for future careers.

I have got my bachelor degree in Shan Dong University in China. My major was international finance and trade. On that days, I have learnt about the practices about international trades and some academic basis.

I love coding and computer games. When i am energetic, I like to scratch the github for something interesting to equip my laptop. When i am tired, an exciting game will refresh me. I master python and R. I like dogs cause i think they are lovely and the symbol of loyalty.
