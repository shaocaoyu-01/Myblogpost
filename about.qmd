I’m a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University. I’ve learned to wrangle messy data, communicate insights, and build clear visualizations—skills that equip me well for data-driven roles.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in International Finance and Trade from Shandong University (China), where I studied trade practices and built a solid foundation in economics and quantitative methods.

I enjoy coding and computer games. When I’m energized, I like exploring GitHub for interesting tools to tinker with; when I’m tired, an exciting game helps me reset. I’m proficient in Python and R. I also love dogs—their loyalty and warmth always make my day.
