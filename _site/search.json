I confirm that these skills could equip me for future careers.\nI have got my bachelor degree in Shan Dong University in China. My major was international finance and trade. On that days, I have learnt about the practices about international trades and some academic basis.\nI love coding and computer games. When i am energetic, I like to scratch the github for something interesting to equip my laptop. When i am tired, an exciting game will refresh me. I master python and R. I like dogs cause i think they are lovely and the symbol of loyalty."
