    "text": "Problem description\nEmerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility (e.g., Delta) stress hotel-based quarantine. We evaluate a fixed quarantine protocol with a 14-day minimum stay and RT-PCR testing on days 3 and 12; detected cases are isolated for 10 days, and their close contacts receive a 14-day extension with tests on days 3 and 12. The facility hosts 100 travellers (arriving in close-contact groups of four) and 20 vaccinated workers who are RT-PCR tested on each workday (≈5 days/week). Contact controls reduce traveller-worker transmission by ×100 and worker-worker by ×10. We vary vaccine efficacy against transmission from 0–90% and transmissibility from R₀=3 (ancestral benchmark) to R₀=5–10 (Delta-plausible). Breach events are defined as instances where an infectious traveller or worker has unprotected contact with the community; performance is measured by the integrated force of infection from breaches and the outbreak risk/time derived from those breaches. We benchmark “acceptability” relative to the ancestral baseline (R₀=3, VE=0). The base infected-arrival rate is 1%, reduced to (1−VE)×1% for vaccinated cohorts. Within a 100-traveller, 20-worker facility using 14-day quarantine with RT-PCR on days 3 & 12 (cases: 10-day isolation; close contacts: 14-day extension with tests on days 3 & 12), base infected-arrival prevalence = 1% (scaled by 1−VE), and R₀ ∈ {3,5,…,10}, success = lower breach-induced community force of infection and longer outbreak-free time than the ancestral baseline (R₀=3, VE=0)\nAnalysis The article setting is a hotel-based, low-tolerance border quarantine system operating under a fixed protocol. The model treats both arriving travellers and quarantine workers as possible infection sources and tracks contacts inside the facility and potential breach to the community. Scenorio grid varying viral transmissibility (ancesteral —-&gt; higher transmissibility variant such as Delta) and vaccine efficacy against infection. Routine PCR testing for travellers/workers according to the protocol; infection detected —-&gt; isolation; defined PPE/contact-reduction rules reduce specific contact pathways. A breach event is counted when an infectious traveller or worker has uncontrolled contact with the general population. These breaches are converted into measures of community infection pressure and outbreak risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Breach risk across transmissibility levels.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, we could get to know that with the transmissibility increase from 3 to 5-10, the β has increased. Besides, but with the vaccine efficiency increase to 0.9, the β value dropped to 0.216. We could confirm that the initial quarantine system could function after the efficient vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Outbreak-free time vs vaccine efficacy.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, we could see that the time until outbreak 50% probability will increase when VE increase. So we could confirm that the under whatever transmissibility, the higher VE, the longer time until outbreak.\nConclusion\nReference"
